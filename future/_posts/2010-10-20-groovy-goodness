p(meta). 20 October 2010

Tonight one or more teams will be working on JBehave and its new Groovy language capability.

Also, Richard will be pushing ahead with JProxy's early stages.  We have a Maven tool-chain, and a few initial test cases (as well as proofs of concepts, and goals), but there is much to do to get this to an 'beta' state.

Bill will be working on his particle engine again. He'll accept as many pairs as are willing to throw themselves into Objective-C and XCode (maybe download xcode before you come).

Android may figure again this week for the small "Sold/Tangent" app we're building.

Cosmin will be doing *something* with Clojure with whoever wants to pair with him.

Yujun will ..
